CTM00000025	Cost:
CTM00000026	The station is currently being used by Jackal gang members to harrass travelers on the I-15, but they can easily be dealt with. Once the station is occupied, [%] will be able to keep a close eye on traffic moving in and out of the Mojave Outpost.

CTM00000032	[%] is now under the control of [%].
CTM00000033	In a very literal sense, power is the prize of the Mojave. While the energy outpost of this small wind farm is almost nothing compared to Helios One or the Hoover Dam, it is still another valuable source of power that should be secured by [%].

CTM00000038	With the Jackals dead, the Prospectors have returned to the Den. They may be interested in protection from [%] to prevent future gang attacks.
CTM00000039	Rename the Den
CTM00000040	To claim this bunker for an Independent New Vegas, you will need to determine if you want to keep this bunker for yourself and Yes Man, or reach out to one of the smaller factions found in the wasteland such as the Brotherhood of Steel or the Followers of the Apocalypse.
CTM00000041	[CRLF][CRLF]If you want to go it alone in taking over the Mojave, you'll need to have upgraded the Securitron army and activated the Securitrons army under the Fort.
